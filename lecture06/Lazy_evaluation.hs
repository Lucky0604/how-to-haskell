{-
Lazy evaluation
nder a lazy evaluation strategy, evaluation of function 
arguments is delayed as long as possible: 
they are not evaluated until it actually becomes necessary to do so

-- | two funcs
f1 :: Maybe a -> [Maybe a]
f1 m = [m, m]

f2 :: Maybe a -> [a]
f2 Nothing = []
f2 (Just x) = [x]
-- | important thing to note is that thunks are evaluated only enough to allow a pattern match to proceed, and no further!

{-
pattern matching drives evaluation
- Expressions are only evaluated when pattern-matched
- â€¦only as far as necessary for the match to proceed, and no farther!

Carrying out the evaluation step-by-step looks something like this:

  take 3 (repeat 7)
      { 3 <= 0 is False, so we proceed to the second clause, which
    needs to match on the second argument. So we must expand
    repeat 7 one step. }
= take 3 (7 : repeat 7)
      { the second clause does not match but the third clause
        does. Note that (3-1) does not get evaluated yet! }
= 7 : take (3-1) (repeat 7)
      { In order to decide on the first clause, we must test (3-1)
        <= 0 which requires evaluating (3-1). }
= 7 : take 2 (repeat 7)
      { 2 <= 0 is False, so we must expand repeat 7 again. }
= 7 : take 2 (7 : repeat 7)
      { The rest is similar. }
= 7 : 7 : take (2-1) (repeat 7)
= 7 : 7 : take 1 (repeat 7)
= 7 : 7 : take 1 (7 : repeat 7)
= 7 : 7 : 7 : take (1-1) (repeat 7)
= 7 : 7 : 7 : take 0 (repeat 7)
= 7 : 7 : 7 : []
